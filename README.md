Requirements Done
Additional Guidelines
 - [x] 1. Use a Github repository to manage the source code. A clear Git history showing your process is required.
Commit your changes to git in small chunks with meaningful comments.
- [x] 2. The app should target Android version 7.1 (v25). Donâ€™t worry about backwards compatibility for this task.
- [x] 3. The list should scroll smoothly. As much data as possible should be cached.
- [x] 4. Comment your code where necessary.
- [x] 5. Polish your code as much as possible.
- [x] 6. Feel free to use any best-practice open-source libraries/examples you need, just be sure to give credit. Do
not use beta versions of any libraries.
- [x] 7. Include at least two UI unit tests; one that asserts the state of the screen when set up with all data present,
and one that asserts the state of the screen when in an error state.
- [x] 8. Handle screen rotation efficiently.

- [x] in this application we used Glide, retrofit and room library
